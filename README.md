# hiveBroker the story
`hiveBroker` can be your starting point for all your TiddlyWikiClassic collections.\
TiddlyWikiClassic is traditionally used in a browser like Firefox or Chrome or in [TiddlyDesktop](https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/TiddlyDesktop).\
TiddlyWikiClassic is build with HTML, JavaScript and CSS and can be described as a unique non-linear notebook for capturing, organising and sharing complex information. The information is stored in so called tiddlers, this can be text, images, executable code, there is no limit on what you can put into a tiddler.\
Over the years saving a TiddlyWikiClassic in a browser became more and more difficult and I started looking for something else.\
My starting point was that I only wanted to use TiddlyWikiClassic, on NW.js or Electron, with a very open architecture.\
The first very basic saver I wrote was for the NW.js platform, it was stable and reliable so I stayed with NW.js.\
`hiveBroker` was than created to manage, organize and categorize TiddlyWikiClassic collections that ran on NW.js.\
From `hiveBroker` you can open any TiddlyWikiClassic in a new window. The same as one would use tabs in a browser.\
The hiveBroker-Plugin.js is the pivot plugin that makes this possible, this plugin can generate a tiddler with file information in it for all folders/files in selected folders on your drive.\
The generated tiddlers have buttons to do basic operations like delete, rename, copy and open your TiddlyWikiClassic in a new window.\
A dashboard that is generated from tiddlers shows bagdes for all TiddlyWikiClassic or files that you selected, be it by extension, badge color or tags. The badges are sorted by number of clicks, the most used TiddlyWikiClassic's float to the top.

> `hiveBroker` is still under development but breaking changes are not expected.

## Install
To install download the Linux or Windows zip file of your choice, unpack and start by clicking on the nw or nw.exe file.\
`hiveBroker` uses the [nwSaver-Plugin.js](https://github.com/qbroker/nwSaver) for saving.

The dashboard looks like here below, or just try it [here](https://qbroker.github.io/hiveBroker/).\
Unfortunately saving TiddlyWikiClassic does not work on GitHub pages.
