# hiveBroker
`hiveBroker` can be your starting point for all your classic TiddlyWiki's.

The hiveBroker-Plugin.js runs in a classic TiddlyWiki on NW.js and gives you a dashboard to manage, delete, copy and start your classic TiddlyWiki's with ease.
The dashboard shows you bagdes for all classic TiddlyWiki's that you selected, sorted by number of clicks.
> `hiveBroker` is still under development breaking changes are not expected.

## Install
To install download a zip file of your choice, unpack and start by clicking on the nw or nw.exe.
`hiveBroker` uses the [nwSaver-Plugin.js](https://github.com/qbroker/nwSaver) for saving.

The dashboard looks like here below or try it here [hiveBroker-Plugin.js](https://qbroker.github.io/hiveBroker/).
Unfortunately saving and opening TiddlyWiki's does not work on GitHub pages.
