# hiveBroker
hiveBroker can be your starting point for all your TiddlyWikiClassic.

This TWC gives you a dashboard to manage, delete, copy and start your TWC from one spot and it is build with TWC.
hiveBroker tracks your TWC's and automatically creates a badge for any new TWC so it can be used.
At the moment hiveBroker is under development and there will be breaking changes.
Installation will be possible by a installer script that downloads NW.js and install the TWC's in the correct folders.
hiveBroker uses the nwSaver-Plugin.js.
